We can achieve Runtime Polymorphism in Java using inheritence.
 -> When an overridden method is called through a superclass reference, Java determines which version(superclass/subclasses)
    of that method is to be executed based upon the type of the object being referred to at the time the call occurs. 
    Thus, this determination is made at run time.
    
-> This is not applicable for data members.
